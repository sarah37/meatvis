<h1>About</h1>

<p>MeatVis is a project of second year students of University College Twente. The project assignment was to mitigate a real world problem, in this case negative consequences of meat production and consumption. MeatVis aims to provide meat consumers with access to information and display this information in an interactive and easily understandable way. Our product will raise awareness of production standards.</p>

<p>The project group consists of Valerie Lapp, Qiao Ren and Sarah Schöttler. The general aim and strategy of MeatVis was thought up by the entire project group. We also decided on the structure of the website together and made rough storyboards of the information presented.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Valerie was responsible for the collection of data and composition of all pieces of text that are available on the website. Qiao implemented the visualization plans for the water depletion sub-page using Adobe Illustrator. Sarah constructed the website including the starting page and the map using HTML and CSS combined with the D3 library.</p>

<h1>Scenario</h1>

<p>In the following an ideal scenario will be presented of how a user will interact with MeatVis.</p> 

<p>The user is doing groceries for her family. She takes a meat product off the shelves and turns to continue her shopping when she sees a screen displaying the message: “You are planning to buy meat? Scan your product here!”. Her curiosity is triggered and she proceeds to scan the meat product she just put in her shopping cart. On the screen a message appears asking her what she cares about. She thinks about her family and her kids’ love for animals and chooses “That animals don’t suffer”, “The health of myself and my family” and “The future of my children”. Promptly, a map gets generated including information on animal welfare, health, and greenhouse gas emissions. She clicks on some of the dots and is especially taken aback by the information about antibiotics resistances and the fact that even highly developed countries like France and Australia mistreat animals. She gets invited to explore alternative products and accepts the invitation by clicking a button. As a consequence, she sees a meat product (same type of meat that she was intending to buy) that has been audited by an animal welfare institute. It’s indicated on the screen where in the store this alternative product is located. She decides to exchange her product with the suggested alternative. The alternative product is slightly more expensive, but she is willing to pay the increased price in exchange for knowing that the animals have been treated fairly.</p> 

<p>After she has arrived at home, she decides to explore the topic even further. She visits the MeatVis website and reads through the in-depth description of animal welfare. This confirms her in her decision to have bought the alternative meat product.</p>
