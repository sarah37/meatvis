<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The dynamics of global meat production are complex and mostly not transparent to consumers, making it hard to holistically assess the impact of their purchase. Studies have shown that the majority of people living in Western countries is not aware of the fact that there is a connection between meat consumption and environmental issues. Only 12% of Dutch respondents knew about this connection, in the USA it was even less (de Boer, de Witt, &amp; Aiking, 2016), (Macdiarmid, Douglas, &amp; Campbell, 2016). On the other hand, a dietary shift is being noted by many researchers. Even though meat consumption is increasing in most countries, vegetarianism is broadly accepted and there are some countries with a trend towards eating less meat. In general, researchers have noticed that initially meat consumption increases with income until at a certain income level saturation is reached. From that point onwards, increased income leads to decreased meat consumption (Mathijs, 2015).</p>

<h1>Goal</h1>

<p>The goal of the product MeatVis is to raise awareness and through this lay the groundworks for a potential behavioral change of the users. We don’t aim to convert users to vegetarianism or veganism, but turn them into more rational meat eaters, who are aware of the consequences of their behavior, eat meat in moderation and embrace the opportunities of less harmful meat products such as organic or locally produced meat. The product is designed to be deployed in the Netherlands. Despite being a high income country, meat consumption in the Netherlands is still relatively high compared to other high income countries. 11.9% of energy intake in the Netherlands is obtained through meat. In Germany (2.3%), Belgium (3.5%) and even the USA (3.5%) this number is significantly lower (Mathijs, 2015). </p>

<h1>Strategy</h1>

<p>The strategy to achieve this goal is to present the user with explanatory visualizations tailored to their personal interests and values. Making the visualizations interactive allows the viewers to interact directly with information in order to construct their own understandings of it. Explaining the connection between meat consumption and climate change to consumers is complicated, because it challenges their habits and preconceptions. Research has shown that using simple messages and visualizations might lessen the “conceptual leap” for many (Wellesley, Happer, &amp; Froggatt, 2015, p. 34).</p>

<p>We are implementing interactive storytelling in the representation of our information and data. Framing data as a narrative makes it more interesting and memorable for the user. Adding the interactive part further increases comprehensibility, credibility, and involvement (Ma, Liao, Frazier, Hauser, &amp; Kostis, 2012). There is so much data available about meat production and consumption, that it the average citizen might find it challenging and daunting to obtain a good overview. We preprocess the data and thus enable the user to explore the information in an intuitive and fast way. </p>

<p>In our product MeatVis the user first sees a screen inviting him/her to scan their meat product. Curiosity will spark the interest of potential users. After scanning, they get asked to select topics they care about that are all related to possible consequences of meat consumption, including animal welfare or health, that are proven to have the largest impact in reducing people’s meat consumption (Cordts, Nitzko, &amp; Spiller, 2014). Next, the user will see a world map that is generated according to their selection of topics they care about. Colorful dots indicate locations where incidents related to the respective topics happen or have happened, e.g. an outbreak of bird flu (health) or lenient legislation on animal rights (animal welfare). Using a map shows that problems related to meat are a global phenomenon. If the user finds one of the stories particularly interesting, it is possible to click a button and get redirected to a page with additional in-depth information.
After learning more about how eating meat affects certain values that the user cares about, he or she is presented with alternative purchase options that are more in line with their beliefs and values. A lack of easy access to alternative food options is a major barrier to dietary change (Wellesley et al., 2015), MeatVis changes this by suggesting products that are directly available in the same store.</p>

<p>Trusted sources are essential for raising awareness and successfully promoting change in meat consumption (Wellesley, et al., 2015). The fact that MeatVis is not affiliated with the government or the meat industry but instead is an independent group using information based on scientific research might make us appear more credible. </p>

<h1>Stakeholders</h1>
<h2>Target group/ Users</h2>

<p>There are a multitude of factors that influence people’s meat consumption such as social class, gender, culture, age, income or educational level (Wellesley et al., 2015). Meat consumers are a highly diverse group, making it hard to persuade all of them to change their behavior using the same strategy.</p>

<p>Possible reasons for customers to buy meat are not knowing about the negative consequences, not caring about the negative consequences, not knowing what else to buy (possibly because alternatives seem too expensive). The information provided by MeatVis is going to fill the knowledge gap of the first group, direct yet another persuasion effort towards the second group, and display alternatives to the third group where non-meat alternatives are likely to be cheaper. By mixing positive and negative messages (e.g. meat is an important source of protein, but overconsumption has proven to be bad) we try to avoid defiant reactions.</p>

<p>MeatVis will focus on those who are already open to the idea of reducing their meat consumption and those who are already informed about the driving forces of climate change. Among the people with low awareness, women, elderly people and high earners will most likely be more receptive (Wellesley et al., 2015).</p>

<h2>Food retailers</h2>
<p>Increasing awareness of health and environmental effects of dietary choices is becoming more mainstream. Retailers are starting to become interested in playing a role in this movement, which has the potential to secure them a competitive advantage (Scollan &amp; Moran, 2010). Introducing a product like MeatVis will make a supermarket look like they are honest and transparent and care about the quality and impact of their products. Furthermore, it gives them the opportunity to advertise more sustainable alternatives and thus shift their customers buying behavior to products that might possibly generate a higher revenue.
MeatVis is intended to be used at supermarkets whose customers include our target group. These are most likely to be retailers such as Albert Heijn that focus on high level service and a big product assortment that includes high quality products.</p>

<h2>Meat suppliers</h2>
<p>Meat suppliers can pay money for their products to get mentioned in the product as an alternative purchase idea. In order to fulfill the requirements for this, they have to be certified to for example be organic, local, or use humane slaughtering methods. </p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>The visualizations will be shared in two main ways: through a website and displays in supermarkets. In the supermarket, customers can directly interact with the device, scan the product they chose and look for alternatives. This location ensures that the message is accessible. Having a website allows users to explore the information more thoroughly, since there might not be sufficient time while doing groceries. Costs will be covered by adding advertisements in the form of suggesting sustainable alternatives, both meat and non-meat in nature, to consumers. </p>

<p>Part of the service that MeatVis provides is to make a database of all meat products offered in the supermarket and their relevant attributes as far as they are known and available (country of origin, type of meat, production system, potential quality labels). This will enable MeatVis to generate a map that is in line with the product the user is intending to buy. This is achieved by storing the database together with the UCP (universal product code) of the meat product.</p>

<h1>Proof of Concept</h1>
<p>Displayed on this website is a proof-of-concept-version of the final product. Scanning the meat product to receive specific information is not supported. Users can pick different topics they are interested in and will get suggestions on a map. Both the topics and choice of stories on the map should be expanded for the final version. Of the in-depth information pages, only one has been created (water depletion). These pages should also be created for the final version. Lastly, product suggestions are not implemented here.</p>
