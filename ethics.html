<h1>Value Sensitive Design</h1>

<p>In our project MeatVis we are attempting to mitigate the problem of unreflected and uninformed meat consumption by individuals. We are not aiming at converting people to vegetarianism or veganism, but at using an interactive website to raise their awareness when it comes to potential consequences of their choice to eat meat. The dynamics of the global production are complex and mostly not transparent to consumers making it hard to holistically assess the impact of their purchase. Hopefully, the product will stimulate them to change their behavior into buying more sustainable (local, organic, otherwise certified) meat products or non-meat alternatives that are more in line with their personal values. Our strategy is to target people with personalized visualizations at the location where the meat purchase takes place. By showing direct evidence of the consequences of meat consumption, we try to increase knowledge and prevent moral disengagement when it comes to making choices about meat purchases.</p>

<p>When analyzing the moral aspects and values inherent to the project, one can differ between values related to the problem of excessive meat production and consumption that we are trying to mitigate and values related to the design and usage of the product. </p>

<h1>Underlying values</h1>
<p>The values behind the mitigation problem are threefold: mitigation is important for the well-being of humans, the well-being of animals and the viability of the environment. It is important to note that the three are interconnected (environmental degradation is likely to have a negative impact on humans and animals, animal suffering might inflict negative emotions in humans).</p>

<p>Even though meat may be an important protein and nutrition source for humans, overconsumption has been linked with chronic diseases like cancer. Pathogens and other harmful substances transmitted by livestock also may negatively affect human health. Health is one of the main values embedded in our society. In accordance with that research has shown that together with animal welfare, health has the largest impact in reducing people’s meat consumption (Cordts, Nitzko, &amp; Spiller, 2014). However, as Bruhn states health “competes with many other values, including wealth, power, security, knowledge, and social acceptance” (1989, p.80). This might hinder shifting people’s health behaviors. The fact that consequences of unhealthy behavior such as eating too much meat often unfold only later complicates matters even further.</p>

<p>Animal wellbeing is thoroughly discussed in literature of ethics. In “Animal Liberation” (1975), Singer develops the concept of speciesism which describes the phenomenon of discrimination on the grounds of belonging to a different species. He argues that animals are sentient beings, meaning they can experience pain and pleasure, therefore they deserve equal consideration. Equal consideration is not synonymous to equal rights. Singer still acknowledges that there is a difference between humans and animals because humans have a greater mental capacities that may lead the to them suffer more than animals would under equal circumstances. </p>
<p>Singer’s view is grounded in the concept of utilitarianism that aims to minimize suffering.  He can thus be said to extend anthropocentrism to sentientism. </p>

<p>When extending your understanding of what has intrinsic value even further, one arrives at biocentrism, the belief that all that lives have a direct moral standing (Jamieson, 2008) or even ecocentrism that endows even ecosystems and species as a whole with a value. Others say that nature is only valuable because it gives value to people in form of  its economic value or life support value. No matter which stand you take, protecting the environment from harm will be the logical consequence. Our product also stresses the environmental impact of meat production, including deforestation, loss of biodiversity, water depletion and pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions. </p>

<p>The product MeatVis confronts meat buyers with all the above mentioned values. Even though different people will have different value priorities, the majority will agree that personal health, animal welfare and preserving the environment are to be supported. However, the likelihood of a behavioral change will depend largely on how much the values MeatVis stresses are in line with the values of the user and whether the behavioral change might be contradictory to other values important to the user.</p>

<p>Shalom Schwartz developed a universal value set that includes ten values: Self-direction, Stimulation, Hedonism, Achievement, Power, Security, Conformity, Tradition, Benevolence, and Universalism (Schwartz, 1994). When applying this set of values to MeatVis, some of the values support, others contradict a reduction in meat consumption.
Universalism supports the welfare and protection other others which includes humans as well as animals and the environment. Therefore, people scoring high on universalism are likely to be more receptive to MeatVis, a similar line of argument can be made for Benevolence. People scoring high on Stimulation and Self-Direction are curious, more open to change and new experiences and might therefore also embrace a change in dietary habits more easily. Power is associated with social status, and prestige. Since meat is a symbol for masculinity and social dominance (Allen, Wilson, Ng, &amp; Dunne, 2000) and potentially wealth, people scoring high on power might be less likely to be open to our product. Valuing Security is connected to valuing health, safety and protection of resources, which sounds similar to potential benefits of reduced meat consumption that MeatVis presents. Conformity stands for minimizing social conflict by sticking to social norms. Conformity could have a negative impact on people’s openness for MeatVis as meat consumption is embedded in our society. However, this also depends on the social environment of the respective person. Hedonistic people might see eating meat as an immediate way of finding pleasure and thus also have a negative predisposition towards MeatVis. </p>

<p>Thus, MeatVis will most likely confront the user with conflicting values. While MeatVis makes sure the user get educated about the connection between meat the respective values, it’s up to the user to weigh their personal values and finally come to a conclusion in regards to changing their consumer behavior.</p> 

<p>Furthermore, this project assumes a limited ability of technology to solve the problem of a high demand for meat, but instead assumes that there is a collective responsibility of all consumers that arises because every single meat purchase contributes to the expected harm (Kagan, 2011). </p>

<p>On top of this, there are some values related to the design and usage of the product. 
First of all, we assume a certain level of trust from the user. They have to trust the designers that the provided information and the suggestions of alternative purchases are indeed “better” than their original intention. We as the designers have to trust the labels certifying the products as organic or humanely slaughtered etc. Jamieson calls this way of being a conscientious omnivore risky, but it’s impossible to find better alternatives that don’t involve an extreme lifestyle change (Jamieson, 2008). It’s necessary that we make the choice of alternative product transparent, so that suppliers have the chance to adapt their product accordingly. The fact that MeatVis is not affiliated with the government or the meat industry, but gets their information from scientific publications will make it seem more credible. </p>

<p>A possible unintended consequence of this product could be that users feel pressured into changing their behavior because they are confronted with possible negative aspects of what they are doing. The resulting sentiment might be defiance. Therefore it’s important that we as the designers don’t take a patronizing role, but ultimately still give the user the freedom of choice. In general, we assume that people are aspirational by nature and open to changing their behavior to the better. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, there is a certain conflict between careful handling of the users and the truthfulness of the message. In order to keep the users happy, it’s impossible to bombard them with negative imagery and shocking information, but instead have a mix of positive and negative messaging that conveys a clear message towards the desired behavior without seeming pushy or preachy. Since our goal is to raise awareness and maintain openness to a behavioral change, this trade-off is necessary.</p>

<p>All in all, our project covers a multitude of values because we are aiming at covering the issue of meat production and consumption as holistically as possible. Finding the right balance between a truthful depiction of the problem while guaranteeing a positive customer response is a challenging task.</p>
