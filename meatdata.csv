1,China,35.86166,104.195397,animal,Animal Rights,"China currently has no animal-welfare laws. Many farming methods that the EU is trying to reduce or eliminate are commonplace in China, including gestation crates, battery cages, early weaning of cows, and clipping of ears/beaks/tails."
2,Australia,-25.274398,133.775136,animal,Animal Rights,"Live animal export is an important part of Australia's economy. Being shipped over long distances is very stressful for the animals, which increases their suceptibility to diseases."
3,France,44.734828,0.408447,animal,Animal Rights,"In 2001, EU legislation imposed a ban on sow stalls. A sow stall is a type of metal enclosure  in which female pigs are kept during pregancy. The size does not permit them to move freely. Unfortunately, France and some other countries are still not complying with this law."
4,"Zoeterwoude, Netherlands",52.120831,4.51657,health,Health,"In 2014, there was an outbreak of bird flu in a poultry farm in Zoeterwoude, probably brought by birds migrating from Asia. Hundreds of people worldwide have died because of bird flu. Emerging diseases, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, are closely linked to changes in the livestock production."
5,"Guangzohou, China",23.12911,113.264385,health,Health,"In 2015, researchers from the South China Agricultural University discovered Colistin resistance in animals that has spread over the entire globe ever since. Colistin is an antibiotic critical for human health. The widespread use of antibiotics in livestock farming makes many antibiotics useless."
6,USA,42.2842,-74.375914,health,Health,"Meat provides important proteins to the human body. But overconsumption of animal-source foods &ndash; particularly meat, milk and eggs &ndash; has been linked to heart disease and other chronic conditions. In the USA, more than 90 kg of meat per year and person are consumed, way more than recommended!"
7,"Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel, Netherlands",51.974754,4.615877,climate,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"The lowest point of the Netherlands is in Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel. It's almost seven meters below sea level, which makes it very susceptible to rising sea levels. Livestock and it's indirect consequences contribute to a large part of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and are a major driver of global warming."
8,"Waikato, New Zealand",-38.059426,175.437557,climate,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"In New Zealand, almost half of the greenhouse gas emissions are associated with agriculture that plays an important role for their economy. A large fraction of this is due to the lifestock industry."
9,USA,33.233858,-84.054441,climate,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"US methane emissions from livestock and natural gas are nearly equal. Methane is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential a lot higher than that of CO<sub>2</sub>. Domestic livestock produce large amounts of methane as part of their normal digestive process. Also, when animals' manure is stored or managed in lagoons or holding tanks, methane is produced."
10,"Mato Grosso, Brasil",-14.54628,-52.794109,land,Landuse and Deforestation,"Production of animal feed consumes about one-third of total arable land. Especially in Brazil, large parts of the Amazon rainforest are cut down for cattle ranching and growing animal feed, mainly soy. This leads to greenhouse gas emissions, land degradation and loss in biodiversity."
11,"Great Plains, USA",39.400183,-101.291831,land,Landuse and Deforestation,"In the USA, massive amounts of land are used for producing animal feed like corn or soy.  If the food was directly used for human consumption, one hectare could feed 14 people, buy using the food for livestock production, one hectare only feeds three people. "
12,Zimbabwe,-19.015438,29.154857,land,Landuse and Deforestation,"Zimbabwe has lost more than 85% of their original forests, primarily due to raising livestock. Desertification is occurring as a by-product of this deforestation."
13,"Central Valley, California",40.680428,-122.370842,water,Water Depletion and Pollution,"The production of meat, especially on crops for animal food, is very water intense. Crop production is one major reason for the sinking water tables in California's Central Valley. Even though new agriculture and irrigation technologies improve efficiency, the impact of animal feed production is still very high."
14,Argentina,-38.416097,-63.616672,water,Water Depletion and Pollution,The enormous quantity of manure and urine which is accumulated in the feedlots of Argentina is too much to be transformed by micro-organisms in the ground. It filters through to the aquifers and contaminates the groundwater.
15,Vietnam,10.103407,105.501645,water,Water Depletion and Pollution,Due to the growing pig industry in Vietnam the majority of nutrient contamination of water in Vietnam has been found to be attributable to pig waste.
16,India,20.593684,78.96288,food,Developing Countries,"The density of poor livestock keepers is especially high in India. Having livestock holds many advantages for poor and subsistence households. It contributes to the livelihoods of at least 70% of the world's rural poor and strengthens their capacity to cope with income shocks. But large-scale industrial production has displaced many small, rural producers."
17,Ethiopia,9.145,40.489673,food,Developing Countries,"Children play a major role in caring for grazing livestock in developing countries, which may reduce school attendance. On the other hand, ownership of livestock can give households the opportunity to improve the nutritional status of their children."
